## How to start

### download zip or fork and clone project repository

### create a `.env` in the root of your project folder

In order to run the API successfully you will need to create your own dotenv file with the following variables:

- `URL` => `https://superheroapi.com/api/`

- `TOKEN` => (_you will need your own personal access token which you can get from superhero API ->_ `https://superheroapi.com/index.html`)

make sure this file is ignored by git if you plan on pushing this repo anywhere.

### Use `yarn add` to install dependencies

### Use `yarn start` to run application

### Optionally `yarn run server` & `yarn run client` for development
