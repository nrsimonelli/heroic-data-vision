## How to start

### download zip or fork and clone project repository

### create a `.env` in the root of your project folder

In order to run the API successfully you will need to create your own dotenv file with the following variables:

> URL => `https://superheroapi.com/api/`

> TOKEN => (you will need an access token which you can get from superhero API, `https://superheroapi.com/index.html` and log that here)

make sure this file is ignored by git if you plan on pushing this repo anywhere.

### Use `yarn add` to install dependencies

### Use `yarn start` to run application
